    (** A nice pattern for testing bonsai apps is:

        - Define a top level bonsai component [val bonsai : Call_rpc.t ->
       Result.t Bonsai.Component.t] (for some result type Result.t)

        - Your server library defines a [Handle_rpc.t].

        - In prod, one connects to the server passes [call_by_dispatching_exn
       conn] to [bonsai]. This can then be driven using Bonsai_web.Start in the
       normal way. Likewise, your server will use [val implementations] and
       create an actual RPC server.

        - To test this application, one can use [create_server], passing the
       [Handle_rpc] that your server library defined. The resulting [call_rpc.f]
       will feed the RPC directly to the [handle_rpc.f] rather than sending the
       RPC over the network. *)
